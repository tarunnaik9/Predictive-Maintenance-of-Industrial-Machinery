#  Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

##  Problem Statement
Industrial machines often face unplanned downtime due to sudden failures like tool wear, overheating, or power issues. This leads to reduced productivity and increased maintenance costs. The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict such failures in advance using real-time sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance and improving equipment reliability.

---

##  Proposed Solution
We developed a predictive maintenance model using IBM Watson AutoAI, which analyzes machine sensor data (e.g., temperature, torque, rotational speed) to predict failure types before they occur. The system uses a trained classification model deployed via IBM Watson Machine Learning as a REST API, enabling real-time predictions with high accuracy.

##  Results

- Successfully predicted multiple types of failures:
  - Power Failure
  - Tool Wear
  - Heat Dissipation
  - No Failure
- Real-time testing using deployed API returned accurate classifications with confidence scores.
- Outputs were visualized using prediction summary tables and pie charts (AutoAI UI).

##  How to Use

1. Upload the dataset to IBM Watson Studio.
2. Use IBM AutoAI to build and train the model.
3. Deploy the best model as an online REST API using IBM Watson Machine Learning.
4. Use the API to submit sensor values and receive failure predictions.
